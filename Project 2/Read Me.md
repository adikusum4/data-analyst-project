# Credit Score Analysis

Project description
Your job is to prepare reports for the credit division of a bank. You will find out the influence of a customer's marital status and the number of children he has on the probability of default in repaying the loan. The bank already has some data regarding customer credit worthiness.
Your report will be taken into consideration when making credit assessments for potential customers. Credit scoring is used to evaluate a potential borrower's ability to repay their loan.

Answer the following questions:
1. Is there a relationship between having children and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
2. Is there a relationship between marital status and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
3. Is there a relationship between income level and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
4. How do different loan objectives affect a person's probability of defaulting on a loan?

Write the overall conclusion.
