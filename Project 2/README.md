# Credit Score Analysis

Project description
<br>Your job is to prepare reports for the credit division of a bank. You will find out the influence of a customer's marital status and the number of children he has on the probability of default in repaying the loan. The bank already has some data regarding customer credit worthiness.
<br>Your report will be taken into consideration when making credit assessments for potential customers. Credit scoring is used to evaluate a potential borrower's ability to repay their loan.

1. Is there a relationship between having children and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
2. Is there a relationship between marital status and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
3. Is there a relationship between income level and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
4. How do different loan objectives affect a person's probability of defaulting on a loan?

Write the overall conclusion.
