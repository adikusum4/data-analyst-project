    "**Findings:**\r\n",
    "1. There are 2,174 rows with missing values in the 'days_employed' and 'total_income' columns.\r\n",
    "2. The 'days_employed' distribution has strange negative values (for example, a minimum value of -18,388.95 days and a maximum value of 401,755.40 days), which does not seem to make sense in the context of weekdays.\r\n",
    "3. The 'total_income' distribution has a wide range of values, from 3,306.76 to 362,496.65, reflecting the diversity of customer income.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Possible Causes of Loss of Value:**\r\n",
    "1. One possible cause of missing values in the 'days_employed' column may be technical problems or inaccurate data entry. Unreasonable values as seen in the distribution may be the result of errors when filling in this column, such as measurement or data processing errors.\r\n",
    "2. Missing values in the 'total_income' column can also be caused by various factors. Some customers may choose not to provide information about their income, and this could result in a large amount of missing data in this column.\r\n",
    "3. Another possibility is that there is a pattern in the missing values that may be related to the customer's job type or other factors in the data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Possible Dependency or Pattern Check:**\r\n",
    "To understand whether these missing values are related to certain customer characteristics, the next step is to further examine whether there are any dependencies or patterns in these missing values. In this case, we have checked the number of missing values by customer job type. The results show that different types of work have different amounts of missing values. However, next steps may include further statistical analysis or hypothesis testing to confirm the presence of significant patterns or dependencies.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Next steps should include further investigation into the causes of these missing values and finding ways to address the missing values according to the context of the data and the problem to be solved."

    "**Conclusions**\r\n",
    "<br>Based on the analysis results, no special pattern was found that connects certain columns with missing values in the 'days_employed' and 'total_income' columns. The number of missing values in these two columns does not appear to be correlated with the other columns.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To deal with missing values, we can perform the following steps:\r\n",
    "1. **Handling Missing Values on 'days_employed' and 'total_income':**\r\n",
    "    - For the 'days_employed' column, we can fill in the missing values with the average or median value of this column based on job type (income_type), because there is a correlation between job type and 'days_employed'.\r\n",
    "    - For the 'total_income' column, we can also fill in the missing values with the average or median value based on job type (income_type).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Other Value Handling:**\r\n",
    "    - There are no missing values in other columns, such as 'children', 'dob_years', 'education', 'family_status', 'gender', 'debt', and 'purpose'. Therefore, we do not need to perform any special actions on these columns regarding missing values.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Additional Data Cleaning:**\r\n",
    "    - In addition to dealing with missing values, we also need to do additional data cleaning, such as dealing with duplicate data, normalizing data (for example, combining categories with different names), and checking the correctness of existing values.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Data Transformation:**\r\n",
    "    - If necessary, we can perform additional data transformations to prepare this dataset for further analysis, such as changing the data type, merging columns, or extracting new features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Further Analysis:**\r\n",
    "    - Once the data has been cleaned and missing values addressed, we can proceed with further analysis, such as statistical analysis, predictive modeling, or data visualization.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "All of these steps will help us to process the data better and prepare it for further analysis and better decision making."

    "Based on the analysis of child data and loan repayment failure rates, here are some conclusions:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. The correlation between the number of children and loan default is very weak, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.02. This suggests that there is little to no linear relationship between the number of children and the likelihood of default.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Number of Children and Loan Default:** In the customer population, the majority of them do not have children (children = 0). The loan repayment failure rate in this group is around 7.54%, which is relatively low.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Effect of Number of Children:** It is seen that the more children a customer has, the loan repayment failure rate tends to increase. The customer group with one child (children = 1) has a failure rate of around 9.17%, while the customer group with two children (children = 2) has a failure rate of around 9.49%.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Case of the 3-5 Children Group:** Although the number of customers with three to five children is relatively smaller, it can be seen that the loan repayment failure rate is also quite significant, ranging from 8.18% to 9.76%. However, the group with five children (children = 5) did not have any cases of loan failure.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Childless Group:** The group of customers without children (children = 0) has a lower default rate, which may be due to more resources available for loan repayment. However, this analysis still requires further statistical testing to ensure there is a significant relationship between the number of children and loan repayment failure.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "These conclusions may provide initial insight into the relationship between the number of children and loan default rates. However, to make more accurate decisions, it is necessary to carry out more in-depth statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.s testing."

The \"divorced\" group had a lower failure rate, which was around 7.11%, and the \"widow/widow\" group had the lowest failure rate, which was around 6.57%.\r\n",

    "In this analysis, we evaluate the loan repayment failure rate based on credit objectives (purpose_category). The following are the conclusions of the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Credit Objectives and Default Rates:** There are four categories of credit objectives evaluated: \"cars,\" \"education,\" \"housing,\" and \"wedding.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Highest Failure Rate:** The credit destination groups with the highest loan repayment failure rates are \"cars\" and \"education,\" with failure rates of approximately 9.36% and 9.22%, respectively. This means that people who take out loans to buy a car or for education tend to have a higher risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lowest Failure Rate:** The credit destination groups with the lowest loan repayment failure rates are \"housing\" and \"wedding,\" with default rates of approximately 7.23% and 8.00%, respectively. This suggests that people who borrow for a home purchase or for a wedding tend to have a lower risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **General Conclusion:** While there are differences in default rates based on credit goals, other factors such as income, employment status, and personal financial condition can also influence a person's likelihood of defaulting on a loan. Therefore, it is important to consider these factors simultaneously in credit risk analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recommendation:** In banking practice, this information can help financial institutions make better decisions in providing loans. For example, they may consider adjusting interest rates or loan terms based on a customer's credit goals to reduce the risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conclusions are preliminary results of data analysis and can be the basis for further research and deeper decision making in the banking industry."

    "In this data analysis, we evaluate several important data aspects that include the relationship between the number of children, family status, and loan purpose on loan repayment failure rates. In addition, we also addressed the issue of missing data and identified duplicate data. Here are the general conclusions:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Handling Missing Data:** The data contains a number of missing values, especially in the columns \"days_employed\" and \"total_income.\" To address this issue, we fill in the missing values in the \"total_income\" column with median income by income type (income_type). In addition, we also filled in missing values in the \"days_employed\" column with the median number of days worked by income type (income_type). This helps maintain data integrity and avoids bias that can arise from deleting rows with missing values.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Duplicate Data:** In the data analysis process, we found that there were around 0.33% duplicate data in the dataset. We recommend removing this duplicate data so that it does not affect the analysis results.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "General conclusion:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- The correlation between 'family_status_id' 'children' and loan default is very weak, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.02\r\n",
    "- Loan repayment failure rates tend to be higher for individuals with more than 2 children, with the highest rates in groups with 4 children.\r\n",
    "- Repayment failure rates also vary by family status, with the \"civil partnership\" and \"unmarried\" groups having higher failure rates.\r\n",
    "- Credit goals also have an influence on failure rates, with car purchases and education having the highest failure rates, while home purchases have lower failure rates.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We recommend that financial institutions use the results of this analysis to understand different credit risks and make wiser decisions in lending to customers. Further analysis and statistical modeling can be used to understand other factors that influence credit risk in more depth. more depth."
